## installation
I was asked to make a portfolio with some samples of my work aswell as my name an about me a recent photo and how to contact me and a workin Nav bar. First I made a header  that has my name on the right and on the left there is a nav bar that is linked to other parts of the page. In the body I have three projects the first one being a callaboration and the other two as solo projects. I then made the projects have a background color of blue, If you click the blue you will then be directed to the deployed site in a new tab. Under the projects there is the title of the project with a hyperlink to the github repository. On the left side of the page there is an aside that contains the about me and a placeholder picture of myself. At the bottom of the page there is a contact me section that has my phone number and email.
